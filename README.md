***** Boardgame API

The concept of this project was to build a simple API web application utilizing the Board Game Atlas API: https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs

I am currently an Instructor-in-Training with the Eleven Fifty Academy (https://www.elevenfifty.org) and I was tasked to create a quick lesson on how to deploy to Google Firebase.  This development platform is something useful as it allows another aspect for students to explore in deploying their projects.  During this point in their learning, the only interface they have used in deployment is Github.  Soon after, they will work within Heroku.  

Unfortunately, Google Firebase, although seemed very interesting when I personally was first introduced to it, is something I haven't worked greatly within since that introduction.

The secondary aspect to this project was to build something that perhaps I can utilize later as a means to share how-tos on fetch() and DOM manipulation in a simplified manner.

As a final note:  I've included a gitignore that houses my "client id" that is required within the endpoint of the fetched url.  
If you desire to clone this project, please note that you will need to create a variable that declares that Client ID per the API docs provided.
